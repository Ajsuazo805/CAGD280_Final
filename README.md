Cagd 280 Final Feature Project
My approved feature/mechanic is the fire,ice and star power ups from Super Mario Bros
To test my project out you can start by moving the player aroung with A & D for left and right as well as SPACE for jumping
To test out my power ups navigate you way up to the platform slightly below the power up box and jump to hit it
Once you hit it, it will spawn one of the three power ups
Red power up = fire flower (you can kill enemies with this)
Light Blue power up = ice flower (you can freeze enemies with this)
Yellow power up = Star (you can kill enemis with this, however this power up runs out after a few seconds)
